# Problem Sheet solutions: Go

This repository contains some solutions to the Go problem sheet for the module **Emerging Technologies**.
The module is taught to fourth year undergraduate students at [GMIT](http://www.gmit.ie).
The lecturer is [Ian McLoughlin](https://ianmcloughlin.github.io).

#### Compilation
[Go](https://golang.org) must be installed to run these solutions.
They can then be run like in this example:
```bash
$ go build prime.go
$ ./prime 10001
Prime 10001 is 104743
```
